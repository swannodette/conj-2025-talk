* What is ClojureScript?
** A dialect of Clojure that targets JavaScript runtimes
** Delivers a significant portion of `clojure.core`
** Large standard library via Google Closure Library
*** More about that later ...
** REPL integration with JavaScript runtimes (Browser, Node.js)
*** Interactive development from your environment of your choice
** Tightly integrated with Google Closure Compiler Advanced Optimizations
*** More about that later ...
* Why ClojureScript now?
** Functional programming
** RDD
*** REPL Driven Development
** Radically different approach software development
*** So many JavaScript tools are heading to complexity
* ClojureScript @ 14 Years
** Longer than I ever wrote JavaScript by hand!
** Is it still relevant?
*** personally, I'd rather write Clojure ...
*** JavaScript idioms fatigue
*** 2025, no standard library
** Why not just use TypeScript
*** Another brick in the wall 
**** Hello, tech consolidation doesn't favor the worker
*** We can assert our differing philosophies without abandoning our responsibilities
**** The Lisp Curse?
* A Survival Kit
** What do we get out of the box with ClojureScript
** The browsers have greatly improved since React was released
*** Can move a considerable amount of logic into new DOM APIs, CSS
** Remix older lessons with newer lessons
*** HTMX
*** a la carte DOM morphing
* JavaScript Today

* Easy vs. Simple
** Micro-modules, loading deps N times, and deep dependency graphs
** Semantic versioning 🤡
** React is not the problem
*** The mentality cuts across framework choices
**** Addiction to trivial dependencies
* ClojureScript & JS Status Quo
** Clojure community lead the jump to React
** ClojureScript + React is practical
** But 10+ years on, perhaps time to lead the way again
* Where did we go wrong?
** Adopting JavaScript complexity regardless of fit
** Losing sight of the fundamentals
** Adopt the good ideas lead the way again
* Clojurescript Fundamentals
** A dialect of Clojure targeting JavaScript
** Leverage Google Closure Compiler
** Leverage Google Closure Library
* Google Closure Library
** Google stopped maintaining it (externally)
*** So we forked it
** Still a rock solid option for a great many tasks
** Written with a 
* Advanced Compilation
** Pay for what you use
#+begin_src clojure
(.log js/console "Hello world!")
#+end_src
** Closure understand unused literals
** Two aspects of ClojureScript dead code elimination challenging
*** All the data structures refer to each other
*** Printing
* Lite Mode
** Use the original copy-on-write data structures
*** Much simpler implementations
** :elide-to-string
*** printing has to know about all the types
** The following is 6K brotli
#+begin_src clojure
  (->> (map inc (range 10))
    (filter even?)
    (partition 2)
    (drop 1)
    (mapcat identity)
    into-array))
#+end_src
* Light DOM Web Components
** Web Components for a long time synonymous w/ Shadow DOM
*** Shadow DOM is complected
*** If you decomplect
**** plain Web Components
** Web Components work more or less like native components
*** Thus they work with every framework
*** They work with any diffing approach
* Where is all this stuff coming from?
** Source Map Explorer
* Introspect DOM APIs at REPL
* No need to use NPM, script tags
* Smoothing things out
** Using Google Closure to disambiguate methods / namespaces / fields
* Thank You!
