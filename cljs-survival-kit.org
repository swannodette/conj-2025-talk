* ClojureScript @ 14 Years
** Longer than I ever wrote JavaScript by hand for a day job (9 years)
** Is it still relevant?
*** JavaScript idioms fatigue
**** HTMX, DataStar, etc.
** Why not just use TypeScript?
*** Another brick in the wall
*** We can assert our differing philosophies without abandoning responsibility
* JavaScript: Endgame
** The idea micro-modules and deep dependency graphs was never a good idea
*** It wasn't a good idea in 2009
**** And now it's an easy attack vector
** People like to blame React, but it's really mainstream JavaScript developement that jumped the shark
*** And it jumped the shark a very long time, the only difference is scale
* Clojurescript Fundamentals
** A dialect of Clojure targeting JavaScript
** Leverage Google Closure Compiler
** Leverage Google Closure Library
* Advanced Compilation
* Lite Mode
* Thank You!
