* ClojureScript @ 14 Years
** Longer than I ever wrote JavaScript by hand for a day job!
*** Yay ClojureScript!
** Is it still relevant?
*** JavaScript idioms fatigue
*** 2025, no standard library
** Why not just use TypeScript?
*** did we mention JavaScript idioms fatigue?
*** Another brick in the wall
**** Software devs somehow miss the darkside of tech consolidation
*** We can assert our differing philosophies without abandoning responsibility
* JavaScript

* JavaScript: Endgame
** Micro-modules and deep dependency graphs was never a good idea
*** It wasn't a good idea in 2009
**** And now it's an easy attack vector
** People like to blame React, but it's really mainstream JavaScript developement that jumped the shark
*** And it jumped the shark at birth, the only difference is scale
* ClojureScript & JavaScript
** In the beginning
*** Script tags & Google Closure Compiler
** CLJSJS
*** Like Bower but for ClojureScript
** Node.js dependencies
*** It works reasonably well in ClojureScript
*** Very wellin shadow-cljs
* Where did we go wrong?
** Adopting JavaScript complexity regardless of fit
** Losing sight of the fundamentals
** Adopt the good ideas lead the way again
* Clojurescript Fundamentals
** A dialect of Clojure targeting JavaScript
** Leverage Google Closure Compiler
** Leverage Google Closure Library
* Google Closure Library
** Google stopped maintaining it (externally)
*** So we forked it
** Still a rock solid option for a great many tasks
** Written with a 
* Advanced Compilation
** It work's great
*** But it's not magic!
** Two aspects of ClojureScript dead code elimination challenging
*** All the data structures refer to each other
* Lite Mode
* Where is all this stuff coming from?
** Source Map Explorer
* Thank You!
