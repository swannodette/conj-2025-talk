* What is ClojureScript?
** A dialect of Clojure that targets JavaScript runtimes
*** Delivers a significant slice of `clojure.core`
** Includes a very large standard library via Google Closure Library (GCL)
*** More on that later ...
** REPL integration with JavaScript runtimes (Browser, Node.js, V8/JSC Mobile)
*** Stop drawing dead fish 🐟
** Tightly integrated with Google Closure Compiler Advanced Optimizations
*** A trivial `cljs.core` program (+ GCL) is ~3mb of JavaScript
**** After advanced compilation, ~3 bytes
*** More on that later ...

* ClojureScript + JavaScript Tools
** A lot of ClojureScript dev is React
*** We lead the charge, but that's status quo
** React went from a script tag to an all-encompassing ecosystem
** The community has a good grasp on succeeding with it
*** Lots of resources now
** JavaScript tooling is very easy, but not very simple
** ClojureScript provides a smaller set of tools to get the job done
*** Once intimidating, now seems positively tame
** shadow-cljs, figwheel both permit simpler approach to client dev
*** If you stick with what ClojureScript actually offers
* Post-apocalyptic Software Development: A Fairy Tale
🖥💀🧚
** Software Zombie Apocalypse
*** Nobody remembers how to do anything anymore!
** NPM is gone (good riddance!)
** You can't use any ClojureScript libraries!
** You have a few git clones on your 💻
** Inventory: A) Wits 🧗, B) Bare hands 🙌, C) simple, composable tools 🛠
* A Survival Kit: Looking inside
** What's in the box
*** cljs.core, cljs.string, cljs.pprint, ...
*** goog, goog.string, goog.array, ...
** Thing we forgot were in the box
*** new DOM APIs
*** CSS patterns / optimizations
** Techniques outside the box 🧠
*** AJAX / HTMX
*** Morphing - you could write it! (nanomorph.js)
* Google Closure Library
** Google stopped maintaining it (externally)
*** So we forked it
** Still a rock solid option for a great many tasks
** Written with a 
* Advanced Compilation
** Pay for what you use
#+begin_src clojure
(.log js/console "Hello world!")
#+end_src
** Closure understand unused literals
** Two aspects of ClojureScript dead code elimination challenging
*** All the data structures refer to each other
*** Printing
* Lite Mode
** Use the original copy-on-write data structures
*** Much simpler implementations
** `:elide-to-string`
*** printing has to know about all the types
** The following is 6K brotli
#+begin_src clojure
  (->> (map inc (range 10))
    (filter even?)
    (partition 2)
    (drop 1)
    (mapcat identity)
    into-array))
#+end_src
* Light DOM Web Components
** Web Components for a long time synonymous w/ Shadow DOM
*** Shadow DOM is complected
*** If you decomplect
**** plain Web Components
** Web Components work more or less like native components
*** Thus they work with every framework
*** They work with any diffing approach
* Dynamically Constructing Web Components
#+begin_src javascript
  function Popover() {
      return Reflect.construct(HTMLElement,[],PopOver);
  }

  PopOver.prototype = Object.create(
      HTMLElement.prototype, {
          connectedCallback: {
              configurable: true,
              "value": function() {
                  console.log("WHOA!");
              }
          }
      }
  );

* Where is all this stuff coming from?
** Source Map Explorer
* Introspect DOM APIs at REPL
* How can I manipulate the DOM?
** Setting attributes
** Setting styles
* How can I listen for events
** Can I listen for multiple events
** Can I delegate events
* How can I make a custom component
** Can update that component in a functional way?
* How can I build an app?
** Client/Server state management
*** Synchronization complexity
** Client state management
*** Synchronization complexity
** Server management
*** Hrm ...
* Expanding the toolbox 🏚
* The Book of AJAX
** innerHTML/outerHTML
* The Book of React
** Diffing the DOM
** Idiomorph
* Smoothing things out
** Using Google Closure to disambiguate methods / namespaces / fields
* Why ClojureScript in 2025?
** Functional programming
** REPL Driven Development
** Batteries included
** Maximum functionality / Minimal Artifact
** Radically different approach software development
* ClojureScript & JS Status Quo
** Clojure community lead the jump to React
** But 10+ years on, perhaps time to lead the way again
** ClojureScript + React is practical
* Why not just TypeScript?
** Another brick in the wall 
** We can assert our differing philosophies without abandoning our responsibilities
*** The Lisp Curse?
* Thank You!
